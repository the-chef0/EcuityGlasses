# Ecuity Smart Glasses Software
This repo was created to share the code created for the smart glasses concept in the first year of the Autonomous Walking project in the Honors Academy at the Eindhoven University of Technology. If you're reading this, I'm assuming you are one of the people continuing the Autonomous Walking initiative after the 2021/2022 academic year. I'm also assuming you have read the report written by Team Ecuity in May 2022.

This project is essentially an Android app which is eventually meant to be run on smart glasses with a camera, ARCore support and optionally a ToF sensor. Our prototype was implemented on a Huawei P30 Pro which should still be property of the TU/e Honors Academy so you should be able to get access to it.
